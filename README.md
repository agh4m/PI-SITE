# Website for PI

This is a static website hosted in Github pages to detail the progress in our Project DiSA (Digitaly Signed Archive)

### Development

This website was created using a template available [here](https://bootstrapmade.com/flexstart-bootstrap-startup-template/)

While developing it might be useful to serve the website localy using an utility such as [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) which can be started with

```sh
npx serve
```

This will serve the website on `http://localhost:3000`
